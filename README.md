Hello, my name is Ammar Syed Ali
I completed my A-levels from The Lyceum and am pleased to be here at FAST
I was asked about my hobbies in my first introduction so I shall let you know that I love to sketch, play football and read books
Besides that I think I like coding primarily because it is fun, you can play around with the code, let your mind wander and make as many mistakes as you need to
P.S I haven't done much coding
I only did some with the help of a youtube video on Replit on Python but nevertheless, I had a fun time
